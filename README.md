# GFI-Flow-Intelligence: Governance Flow Index Diagnostic Tool

## Overview
This repository contains the **Governance Flow Index (GFI)**, a flow-based diagnostic engine designed to evaluate and optimize institutional systems. Built with Streamlit, it provides IT leaders and CIOs with a quantitative framework to measure "flow intelligence" within complex organizational structures.

## Key Features
- **Flow-Based Diagnostics:** Analyzes systemic bottlenecks using a proprietary GFI metric.
- **Institutional System Mapping:** Visualizes the relationship between governance protocols and operational efficiency.
- **Real-time Interaction:** Deployable via Streamlit for executive-level dashboards.

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/PianoPing/GFI-Flow-Intelligence.git`
2. Install dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application:
   `streamlit run app.py`

## Why GFI Matters for the CIO
In 2026, the bottleneck for digital transformation is rarely the technology itself, but the "Governance Flow" that dictates how data and decisions move through the enterprise. GFI provides the data-driven insights needed to bridge the gap between strategy and execution.
