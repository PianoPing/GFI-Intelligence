st.markdown("""
### Efficiency gains do not eliminate structural risk. They often relocate it.

Financial institutions increasingly rely on AI-driven decision systems:
- Credit scoring
- Fraud detection
- Underwriting automation
- Compliance monitoring
- Customer onboarding

While decision speed improves, structural density often increases in:
- Manual override layers
- Exception routing
- Dispute resolution
- Regulatory validation nodes

We conduct independent structural risk reviews focused on governance exposure.
